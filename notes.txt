    and planning everything else

       ===>   
        fully wire through login verifications and then wire through the routing on reg and test the above compoennts and actions
        with a logged in user:
        c
        make it so users get verified immediately after signup, and then login and if they are not verified they are blocked with a message that sais go verify.
        if they are verified and not activated route them to secondsignupPage fields are null are routed to secondsignuppage where they will 
        enter the pics and other fields.  After that to the Addservice page where they can add the services and pricing.  After they have at least 1 s&p
        sedn to dashboard
    5) tweak the user app to on bookings display a component with the providers info before booking.  Ie after the search click provider,
    see their details and either click back or click forward to book if you like what you see.

    6) test all the components with the new verification signup login scheme make sure everything works

================================================================================================================================================
    make a component for services and pricing that will have an input for service and an input for pricing for all services offered.  Have an
    add button that adds more components if they have more services to add.  can do this for nails, hair etc.  db will
    have to be adjuested with a table that has nails services and pricing linked to providers with colums for price and service. 
    FE user can pull pricing out of there.  

    add in the cloudinary so can upload image in secondSignupPage

    make endpoints for forgotusername and verify and forgotpassword functionality
        api/auth/resendproviderverification
        api/auth/forgotproviderpassword
        api/auth/forgotproviderusername
        api/auth/resetproviderpasswordverify/:userId/:verhas
        api/auth/verifyuser/:userId/:verhash
    make landing page with only login/register or link to user app couple of pictures

    after homepage and login and register are functional, make all components responsive at 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1200 px
    and for user desktop too

    make an error come back to the user every time the actions err out and ie backend doesn't do what you want so they re-do whatever wasn't doesn
    way more error messages are needed id in the logic of every actions error.

    Go through every file in every app and make sure all comments are handled, and all potential errors are handled
