    task 1: image setup
    PSeudo for cloudinary image setup for secondsignupPage

    Task 2: add pricing and services
    PSEUDO for how to add new components for each service/price the provider wants to add:
    //make a state value of {
        nails_services: 0,
        hair_service: 0,
        massage_service: 0

    }
    //make a button in each section where they can add the specific service type
    //if they click the buttton, the state value increments
    //in render loop each section up to this.state.nail_service (ex) and render a component every time
    //make 1 component for all 3 but pass down the type of service as a prop so the messages are different.
    //make an action for edit service and dynamically add the endpoint by passing it in the fnc and then in the url so can use 1 action for all 3
    
    Task 3: fully wire through signup and login verifications and then wire through the routing on reg and test the above compoennts and actions
    with a logged in user:
    c
    make it so users get verified immediately after signup, and then login and if the fields are null are routed to secondsignuppage where they will 
    enter the pics and other fields.  After that to the Addservice page where they can add the services and pricing.  After they have at least 1 s&p
    sedn to dashboard

================================================================================================================================================
    make a component for services and pricing that will have an input for service and an input for pricing for all services offered.  Have an
    add button that adds more components if they have more services to add.  can do this for nails, hair etc.  db will
    have to be adjuested with a table that has nails services and pricing linked to providers with colums for price and service. 
    FE user can pull pricing out of there.  

    add in the cloudinary so can upload image in secondSignupPage

    make endpoints for forgotusername and verify and forgotpassword functionality
        api/auth/resendproviderverification
        api/auth/forgotproviderpassword
        api/auth/forgotproviderusername
        api/auth/resetproviderpasswordverify/:userId/:verhas
        api/auth/verifyuser/:userId/:verhash
    make landing page with only login/register or link to user app couple of pictures

    after homepage and login and register are functional, make all components responsive at 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1200 px
